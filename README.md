For this assignment, I am interacting with a server that provides a  a list of `Students` and their information. I built a  [**single page application**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that shows the information for different students ("criminals").

MFADT Most wanted allows users to search for a specific criminal using the search function at the top. I displays a list of DT Delinquints and their ID number in the crimes database. 

When a criminals name is clicked on, it pulls up their record, displaying their name, photo, crime (created myself with a random number and an array of potential crimes), lists their Modus Operandi (biography), and shows where you can find them online.

### Check It Out
You can try out my application on it's [Project Page](http://projectpagelinkhere.com).

Have fun!
